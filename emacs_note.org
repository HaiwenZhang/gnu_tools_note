* The Theory of Movement

** The Basics
C-x C-f: Find (Open) a file
C-x C-s: Save the buffer
C-x C-w: Write to a new file
C-x s: save all files
C-x b: Switch buffer
C-x C-b: List all buffers
C-x k: Kill a buffer
C-x C-b: Display all open buffers
C-x C-c: Exits Emacs
ESC ESC ESC: Exits out of prompts, regions, prefix arguments and returns to just one window
C-/: Undo Changes
C-x u: Undo Tree
F-10: Activates the menu bar
C-h C <RET> List coding system in use for the current buffer.


** Window Management

C-x 0: Deletes the active window
C-x 1: Deletes other windows
C-x 2: Split window below
C-x 3: Split window right
C-x o: Switch active window

C-x 4 C-f: Finds a file in the other window
C-x 4 d: Opens M-x dired in the other window
C-x 4 C-o: Displays a buffer in the other window
C-x 4 b: Switches the buffer in the other window and makes it the active window
C-x 4 0: Kills the buffer and window

** Frame Management

C-x 5 2: Create a new frame
C-x 5 b: Switch buffer in other frame
C-x 5 0: Delete active frame
C-x 5 1: Delete other frames
C-x 5 C-f: Finds a file in the other window
C-x 5 d: Opens M-x dired in the other window
C-x 5 C-o: Displays a buffer in ther other window

** Elemental Movement

C-f: Move forward by character
C-b: Move backward by character
C-p: Move to previous line
C-n: Move to next line
C-j: Create new line
C-a: Move point to the beginning of the line
C-e: Move point to the end of the line
M-m: Move pont to the first non-whitespace character on this line
M-f: Move forward by word
M-b: Move backward by word

*** Sub- and Superword Movement

M-x subword-mode: Minor mode that treats CamelCase as distinct words
M-x superword-mode: Minor mode that treats snake_case as one word

** Moving by S-Expressions

Balenced expressions include:
  Strings " or '
  Brackets [], (), {}, <>

C-M-f: Move forward by s-expression
C-M-b: Move backward by s-expression
C-M-d: Move down into a list
C-M-u: Move up out of a list
C-M-n: Move forward to the next list
C-M-p: Move backward to the previous list

** Other Movement Commands
M-}: Move forward to end of paragraph
M-{: Move backward to start of paragrah
M-a: Move to beginning of sentence
M-e: Move to end of sentence
C-M-a: Move to beginning of defun
C-M-e: Move to end of defun
C-x ]: Move forward one page
C-x [: Move backward one page

** Scrolling
C-v: Scroll down one page
M-v: Scroll up one page
C-M-v: Scroll down the other window
C-M-S-v: Scroll up the other window

C-x <: Scroll left
C-x >: Scroll right
 
M-<: Move to the beginning of the buffer
M->: Move to the end of the buffer

** Bookmarks and Registers

Bookmark is permanent, register is transient

C-x r m: Set a bookmark
C-x r l: List bookmark
C-x r b: Jump to bookmark
C-x r n: Store number in register
C-x r s: Store region in register
C-x r SPC: Store point in register
C-x r +: Increment number in register
C-x r j: Jump to register
C-x r w: Store window configuration in register
C-x r f: Store frameset in register
** Selections and Regions
C-<SPC>: Sets the mark, and toggles the region
C-u C-<SPC>: Jumps to the mark, and repeated calls go further back the marking
S+<left>,... Shift selection similar to other editors
C-x C-x Exchanges the point and mark, and reactivates your last region
M-h: Marks the next paragraph
C-x h: Marks the whole buffer
C-M-h: Marks the next defun
C-x C-p: Marks the next page
M-@: Marks the next word
C-M-<SPC> and C-M-@: Marks the next s-expression
C-<SPC>, C-g: Deactivates the region

** Searching and Indexing
*** Isearch
C-s: Begins an incremental search
c-r: begins a backward incremental search
c-m-s: begins a regexp incremental search
c-m-r: Begins a regexp backward incremental search
RET: Pick the selected match
C-g: Exit Isearch
M-n: Move to next item in search history
M-p: Move to previous item in search history
C-M-i: "TAB"-complete search string against previous search ring
C-s C-s: Begins Isearch against last search string
C-r C-r: Begins backward Isearch against last search string
C-w: Add word at point to search string
C-M-y: Add character at point to search string
M-s C-e: Add rest of line at point to search string
C-y: Paste from clipboard to search string
M-s w: Isearch forward for word
M-s _: Isearch forward for symbol
M-s .: Isearch forward for symbol at point

*** Occur mode
M-s o: Occur mode
M-n, M-p: Go to next and previous occurrence
<,>: Go to beginning and end of buffer
g: Revert the buffer, refreshing the search results
q: quits occur mode
e: Switches to occur edit mode
C-c C-c: Exits occur edit mode and applies changes

** Other Movement Commands
M-r: Repositions the point to the top left, middle left, or bottom left
C-l: Recenters the point to the middle, top, or bottom in the buffer
C-M-l: Repositions the comment or definition so it is in view in the buffer
C-x C-n: Sets the goal column, the horizontal position for point
C-u C-x C-n: Resets the goal column, the horizontal position for the point
M-g M-g: Go to line
M-g TAB: Go to column
M-g c: Go to character position
